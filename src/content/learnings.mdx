### Microsoft Graph Proxy

 A new in-house CLI tool developed to solve the developer needs of Graph. it is simulated in PS but works on ZSH. It is an API testing tool for MS Graph
 
 Find the repository [here](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-developer-proxy)
 
 Microsoft Graph Developer Proxy is a command line tool that simulates real world behaviours of Microsoft Graph and other APIs, locally

## Getting our basics right with Graph

 > By [Nanddeep Nacchan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanddeepnachan/)
 
**DISCLAIMER: YOU NEED A MICROSOFT TENANT ACCOUNT FOR THIS**

Link to tenant services: [View the learn path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/tenant-management-overview?view=o365-worldwide)

Graph provides a gateway to access various API services that are hosted by Microsoft. As a developer, you needn't understand/worry about the working of the exact service that you're accessing, as long as you understand the data that you're using/transacting with, it works. In a nutshell, it allows you to access all necessary services of the Microsoft product line without particularly worrying about understanding the exact flow.

[Access to the graph explorer](https://aka.ms/ge)

You can freely test all HTTP methods with tools like:
 - Excel
 - Sharepoint site
 - File access into sharepoint server
 - Teams, etc

 The API will allow you to access with an auth token/access token. All end points are OpenAPI compliant. Since they're HTTP compliant, you can directly cURL them. Also there are UI components for services like OneDrive.
 
### Permissions that are required by the app


MS has two methods of access, they are Delegated access and App-Only acesss. 
[Read More](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/permission-overview)

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/images/auth-v2/app-privileges-illustration.png">

User and App share privileges in the first approach, Apps inherit the permission from users in the first case. Whereas the same access control is implemented by the app itself in the second case. The app applies the permissions granted to it and accesses the required resources.

### Closing Note
- **Handle permissions well, too much privilege can cause too much damage**
- **Donot mixup the two approaches, either go kernel level or go user level** (Operating Systems reference guys 😎)
- **Handle responses according to the case**


## Working with tenant IDs

> By [Vinodha]() and [Narasimha Perumal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/narasimaperumal)


### Public and Private Channels

- Access control was implemented by the developers working on teams to avoid multiple redundant teams (Multiple teams with similar members)
- To provide third-party access to the organizational resources, shared channel was implemented
- They're internally done by Azure AD connections and I think as Computer Society developers, we need to use this to our peak advantage

Basically this is nothing big per-se, it just explains how access control is implemented.

 
## How to leverage Microsoft Teams for a better in meeting app experince

> By [Shrushti Shah](https://linkedin.com/in/)

- How to improvize your UX ? 

- You can add extra widges using Polls, YouTube, TPIs, etc.
- As an example: You can do a SCRUM discussion for the previous sprint.
- In meeting dialogue and side panel tabs are two available user elements that can be engaged.
- Sharing a meeting stage:
 - `iframes` can be shared
 - You can make cool UIs inside your Meeting panel.
 

## Developing Messaging Extensions

> By [Siddharth Vaghasia](https://linkedin.com/in/siddharthvaghasia)

- What are messsaging extensions ? 

In a VIT context, this is basically attaching our code files and whatever files we have inside our onedrive account. You can attach custom files and have various features integrated.

- Where can we use them ?
 
 We can use them to implement:
  - Find common classes amongst friends
  - Messaging can easily work through similar extensions, all previews and required tasks can be dealt with
  - You can implement action commands as well, they can directly go work on our Github organization
  - We may need a remainder action for our internal applications, this basically will remind us after xyz time frame and mails us asking us to do our assigned task.
