This Learning path is built on the assumption that the user is familiar with HTML and CSS and with a working knowledge of JS.

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. Libraries in programming languages are collections of prewritten code that users can use to optimize tasks.

## Domain Specifics

Web development is broadly classified into 2. Front end and Back end. Front end is the interface with which the user interacts/the part of the website visible to the user. While the backend is where all the magic happens as I like to say.

## Use Cases

I'm pretty sure the reader understands where the front end is used by now. So let's concentrate on why we chose Reactjs.

Why Reactjs:

- React has a comparatively easier learning curve
- React has a large developer community and is supported by Facebook
- React is really flexible and can be adopted to different use cases with minimal changes
- React components are reusable
- React has better better performance due to the presence of Virtual DOM
- JSX can directly implement HTML
- React hooks and redux
- React has a faster rendering

## Some common practices/principles

- HTML code is developed as JSX
- Modularity is preferred. UI is usually broken into components.
- Find the components whose states change
- Hooks are used extensively
- Declarative coding is preferred over imperative
