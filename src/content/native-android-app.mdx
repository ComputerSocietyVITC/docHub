## Domain Specifics

    There are many technologies which can be used to make Mobile applications. Native app development technologies are used to make OS specific mobile application. The most popular Native android app development technologies are Java and Kotlin, the most popular Native IOS app development technology is Swift. There are also cross-platform technologies which can be used to make both android and IOS apps eg: Flutter, React Native. You might think if we can make apps which run on both the platforms why would one choose the native option, first off cross platform technologies are new. They are constantly evolving so they keep changing. Secondly apps made using cross-platform technologies are slower as compared to the natively build apps. There is also less support for cross-platform to use core OS components which can limit certain features from being implemented. Now let’s talk about Java Vs Kotlin. If you are a beginner to programming, I suggest you to go with java as it will help you understand the essence of programming. Java was the original language supported for android development, but due to a lawsuit between Google and Oracle… Kotlin was introduced. Google actively promotes developers to use Kotlin. So regardless of the language you start with you will have to move on to Kotlin at some point. I personally suggest you to start with Java and then move on to Kotlin.

## Use cases

    We are all addicted to our mobile phones and a major reason for that is the variety of apps available. There will always be scope for app development as more and more businesses are starting to create an online presence. You can also build apps to solve a particular problem which you face. If you publish it on play store and many others who face the same problem will use your app, your app will become a business opportunity.

## Software Development and practices

- Maintain High Code Quality
- Always keep a consistent coding style and accurate Architecture
- Learn How To Use Android Documentation
- Keep Design In Mind
- Always keep your Gradle updated and use the latest Gradle plugin for android.
- Using Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for your project

## General Mistakes you've encountered

First of all everyone will be intimidated by just looking at android studio. It will be overwhelming at the beginning, so I suggest you not to try to learn everything in one go. Learn the stuff which is required for that particular project. Do not get stuck in tutorial hell, start building apps as soon as you learn the basics. Make apps which might be useful for you (real world applications). Learn how to use layouts properly. DO NOT spend time creating your own backend, at the beginner level use [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) as your backend.
